File Handling Assignment

Demonstrate your understanding of Python file handling by completing the following tasks.

Tasks:

    File Creation:

    Create a Python script (file_handling_assignment.py) that does the following:
    Creates a new text file named "my_file.txt" in write mode ('w').
    Write at least three lines of text to the file, including a mix of strings and numbers.


    File Reading and Display:

    Enhance your script to read the contents of "my_file.txt" and display them on the console.


    File Appending:

    Modify the script to open "my_file.txt" in append mode ('a').
    Append three additional lines of text to the existing content.


    Error Handling:

    Implement error handling using try, except, and finally blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError, PermissionError).
